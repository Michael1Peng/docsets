Claude is a family of foundational AI models by Anthropic that can be used in a variety of applications.

## Authentication

Set your `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment. You can get one [from Anthropic here](https://anthropic.com/).

<CodeGroup>

```bash Mac
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=***
```

```bash Windows
setx ANTHROPIC_API_KEY ***
```

</CodeGroup>

## Example

Use `Claude` with your `Agent`:

<CodeGroup>

```python agent.py
from phi.agent import Agent, RunResponse
from phi.model.anthropic import Claude

agent = Agent(
    model=Claude(id="claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620"),
    markdown=True
)

# Get the response in a variable
# run: RunResponse = agent.run("Share a 2 sentence horror story.")
# print(run.content)

# Print the response on the terminal
agent.print_response("Share a 2 sentence horror story.")
```

</CodeGroup>

## Params

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `id` | `str` | `"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620"` | The specific model ID used for generating responses. |
| `name` | `str` | `"Claude"` | The name identifier for the agent. |
| `provider` | `str` | `"Anthropic"` | The provider of the model. |
| `max_tokens` | `Optional[int]` | `1024` | The maximum number of tokens to generate in the response. |
| `temperature` | `Optional[float]` | - | The sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 make it more focused and deterministic. |
| `stop_sequences` | `Optional[List[str]]` | - | A list of sequences where the API will stop generating further tokens. |
| `top_p` | `Optional[float]` | - | Nucleus sampling parameter. The model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass. |
| `top_k` | `Optional[int]` | - | The number of highest probability vocabulary tokens to keep for top-k-filtering. |
| `request_params` | `Optional[Dict[str, Any]]` | - | Additional parameters to include in the request. |
| `api_key` | `Optional[str]` | - | The API key for authenticating requests to the service. |
| `client_params` | `Optional[Dict[str, Any]]` | - | Additional parameters for client configuration. |
| `client` | `Optional[AnthropicClient]` | - | A pre-configured instance of the Anthropic client. |
